# ACLED Azure Tools

A set of Azure functions to update ArcGIS Online feature services with the latest data from ACLED.

## Setup

- setup GH repo
- setup Azure info
- node environment variables
- setup in VSCode
- doc issue with nvm where you have to `nvm alias default <version>` in your OS terminal, then close and reopen VS Code to debug locally. otherwise you may get incompatible node js version errors in output when debugging locally.
